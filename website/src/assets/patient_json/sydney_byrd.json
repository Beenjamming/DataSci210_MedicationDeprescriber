    "AdmissionSummary": "A 55-year-old female with a history of GERD was admitted on 09/15/2024 for acute abdominal pain due to constipation. She presented with a 2-day history of diffuse abdominal pain primarily located in the epigastric region, described as dull and cramping. Symptoms were associated with decreased appetite, nausea, and difficulty passing stool. On admission, her vitals showed a temperature of 98.6°F, heart rate of 85 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 bpm, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical examination revealed a soft but slightly tender abdomen in the epigastric region, with hypoactive bowel sounds. Labs, including CBC, CMP, and lipase, were within normal limits. The patient was diagnosed with acute abdominal pain likely secondary to constipation. Management included admission for observation, initiation of a bowel regimen (docusate sodium and polyethylene glycol), discontinuation of ibuprofen, and encouragement of increased fluid intake and a fiber-rich diet. Over the hospitalization course, her symptoms improved significantly, with decreased abdominal pain and normalization of bowel movements. By 09/17/2024, she was clinically stable, with no abdominal pain or tenderness, and was discharged home with instructions to continue the fiber-rich diet, increase fluid intake, and avoid NSAIDs."
