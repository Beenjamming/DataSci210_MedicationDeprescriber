I performed a face-to-face encounter with the patient and contributed to this note. This is my shared portion of the note.     My date of service is 09/25/23.    MDM Complexity Data  Of the results reviewed the following key test results:   K 5.1  Cr 1.35  Hb 8.5  Platelets 100  Tacrolimus 6.1    Reviewed clinical notes outside my specialty: Rehabilitation.    Reviewed and interpreted the following studies:  CXR September 15 showing bilateral hazy opacities.    MDM Complexity of Problems  Illness/injury posing threat to life or bodily function: Status post lung transplantation immunosuppression.    MDM Complexity Risk  Drug therapy on tacrolimus requiring intensive monitoring for toxicity with lab test or imaging. This patient is at risk for immunosuppression-related complications including life threatening infection malignancy renal toxicity and electrolyte abnormalities and lung allograft loss due to rejection. I have reviewed the patient's immunosuppression regimen with the multidisciplinary lung transplant team. The patient requires close clinical monitoring with adjustments of medications based upon laboratory results.    In addition I would add the following:   ***** ***** ***** is a ***** y.o. man who underwent lung transplant on 10/10/2010 who presents with aspiration PNA.    ASPIRATION PNA:  Zosyn transitioned to Augmentin for total 14 days now completed.  ACHALASIA S/P ***** MYOTOMY/FUNDOPLICATION: Now DNR/DNI following GOC \" discussions. Not interested in ***** for possible repeat dilation. Not interested in longstanding feeding tube feels PO intake contributes meaningfully to QoL. Knows he needs new fitted dentures for safe swallow - planning to obtain through VA as outpatient.  METAPNEUMOVIRUS INFECTION: Prednisone taper currently ***** ***** #***** of 3 days.  PANCYTOPENIA: Likely marrow suppression from metapneumovirus recovering.   IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Prednisone MMF 250 BID tacrolimus.  PROPHYLAXIS: Fluconazole dapsone azithromycin.    ***** ***** MD  Assistant Clinical Professor of Medicine  ***** ***** ***** &amp; ***** ***** *****  ***** of ***** ***** *****  *****.*****@*****.*****              \"</td>\n",

His symptoms first started on Sunday. Initially he had a mild cough associated with dyspnea but by Monday his cough was productive of green sputum and he was severely weak. His son has been measuring his pulse oximetry and noted it has been as low as 84% after exertion.

His son was sick last week and ***** went to the ***** on Saturday. In addition to respiratory symptoms he has also had nausea with one episode of vomiting on Monday and watery stools (more solid per son after he had some ***** this morning).    Of note over the past few weeks he has not been using his upper dentures because of discomfort. Lately he has been noticing that food is \"\"getting stuck\"\" after swallowing.    In the ED he was placed on 3L of supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations over 92%. Normal blood pressure. Respiratory rate documented in the upper 20s.

I performed a face-to-face encounter with the patient and contributed to this note. This is my shared portion of the note.     My date of service is 09/25/23.    MDM Complexity Data  Of the results reviewed the following key test results:   K 5.1  Cr 1.35  Hb 8.5  Platelets 100  Tacrolimus 6.1    Reviewed clinical notes outside my specialty: Rehabilitation.    Reviewed and interpreted the following studies:  CXR September 15 showing bilateral hazy opacities.    MDM Complexity of Problems  Illness/injury posing threat to life or bodily function: Status post lung transplantation immunosuppression.    MDM Complexity Risk  Drug therapy on tacrolimus requiring intensive monitoring for toxicity with lab test or imaging. This patient is at risk for immunosuppression-related complications including life threatening infection malignancy renal toxicity and electrolyte abnormalities and lung allograft loss due to rejection. I have reviewed the patient's immunosuppression regimen with the multidisciplinary lung transplant team. The patient requires close clinical monitoring with adjustments of medications based upon laboratory results.    In addition I would add the following:   ***** ***** ***** is a ***** y.o. man who underwent lung transplant on 10/10/2010 who presents with aspiration PNA.    ASPIRATION PNA:  Zosyn transitioned to Augmentin for total 14 days now completed.  ACHALASIA S/P ***** MYOTOMY/FUNDOPLICATION: Now DNR/DNI following GOC \" discussions. Not interested in ***** for possible repeat dilation. Not interested in longstanding feeding tube feels PO intake contributes meaningfully to QoL.
