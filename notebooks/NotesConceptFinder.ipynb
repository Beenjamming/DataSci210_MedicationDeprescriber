       "AIMessage(content=\"When considering PPI (Proton Pump Inhibitor) deprescribing for a patient at discharge, several factors should be evaluated to ensure safe and effective discontinuation. Here are the key considerations:\\n\\n1. **Indication for PPI use**: Review the original reason for starting the PPI. If the indication was for a short-term condition, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or peptic ulcer disease, and the condition has resolved, deprescribing may be appropriate.\\n2. **Duration of PPI use**: Assess the length of time the patient has been taking the PPI. Patients who have been on PPIs for less than 8 weeks are generally considered low-risk for rebound acid hypersecretion and may be more likely to tolerate discontinuation.\\n3. **Dose and frequency**: Evaluate the dose and frequency of the PPI. Patients on higher doses or more frequent dosing may require a more gradual taper to minimize rebound symptoms.\\n4. **Symptom control**: Assess the patient's current symptoms and whether they are well-controlled on the PPI. If symptoms are well-controlled, deprescribing may be considered.\\n5. **Risk of rebound acid hypersecretion**: Consider the patient's risk of rebound acid hypersecretion, which can occur after PPI discontinuation. Patients with a history of severe GERD, peptic ulcer disease, or those who have been on PPIs for an extended period may be at higher risk.\\n6. **Alternative treatments**: Evaluate alternative treatments for the patient's condition, such as histamine-2 (H2) blockers or antacids, which may be suitable for long-term use.\\n7. **Patient education and monitoring**: Educate the patient on the risks and benefits of PPI deprescribing and the importance of monitoring for rebound symptoms. Schedule follow-up appointments to assess the patient's response to deprescribing.\\n8. **Gradual taper**: Consider a gradual taper of the PPI dose to minimize rebound symptoms. A common tapering schedule is to reduce the dose by 50% every 1-2 weeks until the patient is off the PPI.\\n9. **Patient comorbidities**: Consider the patient's comorbidities, such as osteoporosis, kidney disease, or cardiovascular disease, which may be affected by PPI use or discontinuation.\\n10. **Medication interactions**: Evaluate potential interactions between the PPI and other medications the patient is taking, which may be affected by PPI deprescribing.\\n\\nBy carefully evaluating these factors, healthcare providers can safely and effectively deprescribe PPIs for patients at discharge, minimizing the risk of rebound symptoms and promoting optimal medication management.\", response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 548, 'prompt_tokens': 65, 'total_tokens': 613, 'completion_time': 2.240329263, 'prompt_time': 0.015511181, 'queue_time': 0.005500745, 'total_time': 2.255840444}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-70b-versatile', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_b6828be2c9', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-43a92643-4d9d-41e4-832b-b89648df0cff-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 65, 'output_tokens': 548, 'total_tokens': 613})"

There you had a left heart catheterization and were found to have significant blockages in your left anterior descending ***** 2 and left circumflex arteries.  It was decided that intervention would not be an your best interest and was not performed.  After being able to wean off of dobutamine you transferred to the floor with the cardiology team.  After discussion of the prognosis going forward being poor and discussion with yourself/family you have opted to pursue hospice care upon discharge home.  -There have been some medication adjustments that are included in your discharge packet please make sure to adhere to these new medication changes  -You only have 1 day remaining on your antibiotic course this will be amoxicillin 3 times a day for a 1 g dose each time  -You are being discharged on hospice care at home please coordinate your care going forward with the hospice agency and your primary care provider    It has been a pleasure being part of your care team and the cardiology team wishes you the best of luck going forward  \"'),\n",

Weissella cibaria confusa is a rare human pathogen but has been described as causing disease including bacteremia.
