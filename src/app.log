2024-12-04 21:09:15,740 - FileLogger - INFO - final_explanation: **Medication Recommendation Summary**

Based on the patient's health information, the recommended action for Pantoprazole 40 mg daily is to **stop**. This recommendation is supported by the patient's notes history, which indicates that the patient is receiving Pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis due to hemodynamic instability in the intensive care setting with acute myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation (Source: Patient notes history). However, as the patient is being discharged from the hospital, the need for stress ulcer prophylaxis is no longer present, making it appropriate to stop the medication.
