Based on the patient's health information, the recommended action for the current medication is to **continue**. This recommendation is supported by evidence of associated diagnoses found in the patient's notes history and diagnosis record, including a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, gastric ulcer, and peptic ulcer disease (Source: Patient notes history and Patient diagnosis record).

The patient's current management with lansoprazole is primarily for GI protection due to a history of bleeding GI/gastric ulcer, peptic ulcer disease, and H. pylori infection. Although there is no direct evidence of mild to moderate esophagitis or esophageal inflammation, or treated Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) or reflux symptoms, the patient's history of GI bleed and peptic ulcer disease justifies the continuation of the medication.

Based on the patient's diagnosis record, encounter record, and medical notes history, a recommendation to deprescribe the current medication has been made. This decision was reached due to the absence of a specific diagnosis that would support the continuation of the medication.

Despite searching multiple information sources, no evidence was found to support the presence of conditions such as Barrett's Esophagus, esophageal cell changes, severe esophagitis, or gastrointestinal bleeding, which would typically warrant the use of a PPI.

Patient note from 07/31/2023 metions GERD and patient presented with lansoprazole 15mg daily every morning before breakfast.  Recommend deprescribing.,,8428,deprescribe,"**Medication Recommendation Summary**

Based on the patient's diagnosis search history, a recommendation to deprescribe the current medication has been made. This decision was reached due to the lack of evidence supporting a specific diagnosis that would necessitate the continued use of the medication.

According to the patient's notes history (Source: Patient notes history), the patient's recent EGD revealed mild patchy gastritis, but no severe esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, or active ulcers were noted. The patient's diagnosis record (Source: Patient diagnosis record) and encounter record (Source: Patient encounter record) also failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the presence of conditions that would require the medication.

As a result, the recommendation to deprescribe the medication is based on the absence of a clear diagnosis, rather than the presence of a specific condition that would indicate the need for discontinuation. Further investigation may be necessary to determine the appropriate course of action.","[{'diagnosis_boolean': '0', 'explanation': ""The patient's recent EGD (10/22/22) revealed mild patchy gastritis, but no severe esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, or active ulcers were noted.

Based on the patient's medical history and current diagnoses, the recommended action for the patient's medication is to **deprescribe**. This recommendation is supported by the presence of Treated Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) or reflux symptoms such as acid reflux, heartburn, or regurgitation, as mentioned in the patient's medical notes history (source: notes). However, there is no specific mention of esophagitis or esophageal inflammation, which suggests that the patient's current medication may be more than what is necessary for their current condition.

The patient's diagnosis record and encounter record do not provide sufficient evidence to support the continuation of the current medication, and the primary diagnosis is related to gallbladder disease, which does not typically require long-term PPI use.

Based on the search results from the patient's diagnosis record, encounter record, and medical notes history, a recommendation to deprescribe Omeprazole 40 mg daily has been made.

The primary diagnosis of postprocedural partial intestinal obstruction does not directly indicate the need for a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) like Omeprazole. As a result, the indication for this medication is unclear, and further information is required to determine the necessity of continuing, reducing, or stopping the PPI.

Based on the patient's health information, the recommended action is to **deprescribe** the current medication. This recommendation is primarily driven by the patient's known history of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) and current upper GI symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, as documented in the patient's medical notes history (source: notes). The presence of these conditions suggests that the patient may not require the current medication, and deprescribing may be a suitable option.

Key information supporting this recommendation includes:

* The patient's known history of GERD (source: Patient notes history)
* Current upper GI symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting (source: Patient notes history)
* Lack of evidence supporting the presence of other conditions that may require the current medication (sources: Patient diagnosis record, Patient encounter record)

Based on the patient's health information, a recommendation to deprescribe the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) has been made. This decision was primarily influenced by the patient's known history of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) and active treatment with a PPI, as noted in the patient notes history (source:notes). However, further review of the patient's diagnosis record and encounter record did not provide sufficient evidence to support the continuation of the PPI.

The patient's diagnosis record and encounter record listed the diagnosis as ""Unspecified"" or did not mention any gastrointestinal conditions or symptoms, which suggests that the patient may not require ongoing PPI treatment. Therefore, deprescribing the PPI is recommended to avoid unnecessary medication use and potential side effects.

Based on the patient's diagnosis search history, a recommendation to deprescribe the current medication has been made. This decision was reached due to the lack of explicit confirmation of associated diagnoses in the patient's medical records, including the patient diagnosis record, patient encounter record, and patient medical notes history.

Despite searching these records, no specific diagnosis was found to support the continuation of the medication. The primary diagnosis listed in the patient encounter record is ""Vascular disorder of intestine, unspecified,"" which does not directly correlate with the conditions typically treated with the medication.

As a result, the recommendation to deprescribe the medication is based on the absence of a clear indication for its use, rather than the presence of a specific contraindication or adverse effect.

Based on the patient's diagnosis record and encounter record, a recommendation to deprescribe the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) has been made. This decision was reached due to the absence of evidence supporting a diagnosis that would necessitate PPI therapy. The patient's listed diagnoses, including Arthritis, Hypertension, and Hyperlipidemia, are not directly related to the typical indications for PPI therapy (Patient diagnosis record). Additionally, the primary diagnosis of Influenza A infection does not indicate a need for PPI treatment (Patient encounter record). As a result, the PPI medication is not deemed necessary, and deprescription is recommended.","[{'diagnosis_boolean': '0', 'explanation': ""There is no evidence of Barrett's Esophagus or esophageal cell changes, Chronic Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory (NSAID) use or GI prophylaxis NSAID use, Severe esophagitis including bleeding esophagitis or esophageal ulcer, or History of gastrointestinal bleeding, gastric ulcer, upper GI bleed, or peptic ulcer hemorrhage in the provided information.
