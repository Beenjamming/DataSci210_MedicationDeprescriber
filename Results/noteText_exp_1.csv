Based on the search results from the patient's diagnosis record, encounter record, and medical notes history, a recommendation to deprescribe the Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) has been made.

The provided information does not mention any of the typical indications for PPI use, such as Barrett's Esophagus, esophageal cell changes, severe esophagitis, or history of gastrointestinal bleeding.

As a result, the recommendation to deprescribe the PPI is based on the lack of a clear indication for its use, rather than the presence of a specific contraindication or adverse effect.

Additionally, the patient's 2017 endoscopy shows superficial erosive gastritis, which supports the diagnosis of mild to moderate esophagitis or esophageal inflammation (Source: Patient notes history).

The patient's primary diagnosis is listed as ""Other gram-negative sepsis"" (Source: Patient encounter record), which does not indicate a condition that would typically require a PPI for treatment.

Based on the patient's medical history and current diagnoses, the recommended action for the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication is to **deprescribe**.

The decision to deprescribe the PPI was made due to the patient's documented history of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and the fact that they are currently taking esomeprazole (Nexium) 40 mg daily for GERD management. Additionally, the patient has a history of fundoplication, a surgical procedure often performed to treat GERD.

Based on the search results from the patient's diagnosis record, encounter record, and medical notes history, a recommendation to **deprescribe** the current Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) medication has been made. This decision is due to the lack of evidence supporting a specific diagnosis that would require continued use of the medication.

The patient's primary diagnosis is ""Infection following a procedure, other surgical site, initial encounter,"" which does not directly relate to the conditions typically treated with PPIs. While the patient has a history of mild patchy gastritis and is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to immunosuppression and anticoagulation, there is no evidence of severe esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, or active ulcers that would necessitate continued PPI use.

Based on the patient's diagnosis record, encounter record, and medical notes history, the recommended action for the patient's proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication is to **continue**.

The recommendation to continue the PPI is supported by the presence of a lower GI bleed following a colonoscopy with polyp removal, which is a valid reason for PPI use (Source: Patient diagnosis record). Additionally, the patient has a history of hiatal hernia and potential GERD/reflux symptoms, and is on pantoprazole for GI prophylaxis (Source: Patient notes history).

However, it is essential to note that the patient's symptoms and medical history do not provide clear evidence for some of the specified conditions, such as peptic ulcer disease, gastroduodenal ulcer, or H.

Based on the patient's diagnosis record, encounter record, and medical notes history, a recommendation to deprescribe the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) has been made. This decision was reached due to the lack of clear evidence supporting a specific diagnosis that would necessitate the use of a PPI.

The patient's primary diagnosis is postprocedural partial intestinal obstruction, but there is no direct evidence to suggest that the patient has conditions such as Barrett's Esophagus, chronic NSAID use, severe esophagitis, or a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which would typically require PPI therapy.

The patient's medical notes and encounter records do not provide sufficient information to confirm the presence of conditions such as peptic ulcer disease, upper GI symptoms, or H. Pylori infection, which could also justify the use of a PPI.

Based on the patient's diagnosis record, encounter record, and medical notes history, the recommended action for the patient's current medication is to **stop**.

The decision to stop the medication was made due to the presence of a Completed Helicobacter Pylori (H.

This condition is no longer present, and the patient has completed the treatment course.

The patient's current diagnoses, including Diabetic Ketoacidosis, Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, and Chronic Migraines, do not indicate a need for continued use of the medication.

The recommendation to stop the medication is supported by the absence of evidence for other conditions that would require continued use, such as peptic ulcer disease, upper GI symptoms, or ICU stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Based on the patient's health information, the recommended action for the Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) medication is to **deprescribe**.

The decision to deprescribe the PPI is supported by the following findings:

* The patient has a diagnosis of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), which is a common condition treated with PPIs (Source: Patient diagnosis record).
* The patient is taking pantoprazole 40 mg daily for GERD management, but there is no specific evidence of other conditions that would require long-term PPI use (Source: Patient notes history).
* The patient's GERD symptoms are being managed with medication, but there is no indication of severe esophagitis, bleeding, or other conditions that would require continued PPI use (Source: Patient diagnosis record and Patient notes history).

Overall, the patient's current health status and medical history suggest that the PPI medication can be safely deprescribed.","[{'diagnosis_boolean': '0', 'explanation': ""There is no evidence of Barrett's Esophagus or esophageal cell changes, Chronic Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory (NSAID) use or GI prophylaxis NSAID use, Severe esophagitis including bleeding esophagitis or esophageal ulcer, or History of gastrointestinal bleeding, gastric ulcer, upper GI bleed, or peptic ulcer hemorrhage in the provided information.

Based on the patient's health information, the recommended action for Pantoprazole is to **stop**.

However, the patient's condition no longer requires stress ulcer prophylaxis, making the continued use of Pantoprazole unnecessary.

The patient's diagnosis record and encounter record do not provide evidence of conditions that would require the continued use of Pantoprazole, such as Barrett's Esophagus, peptic ulcer disease, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (Sources: Patient diagnosis record, Patient encounter record).

Ben,,SyntheticPt6,no notes about esomeprazole 40mg,deprescribe,10-No Diagnosis,No indication why patient is taking,,5609,deprescribe,"**Medication Recommendation Summary**

Based on the patient's diagnosis record and encounter record, a recommendation to deprescribe the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication has been made. This decision was reached due to the absence of a clear diagnosis that would necessitate the use of a PPI.

The patient's diagnoses, including Arthritis, Hypertension, and Hyperlipidemia, do not directly relate to the typical indications for PPI therapy. Additionally, the primary diagnosis of Influenza A infection does not typically require PPI therapy.

The search history reveals that the patient does not have a diagnosis of Barrett's Esophagus, esophageal cell changes, Peptic Ulcer Disease, Gastroduodenal ulcer, Upper GI Symptoms, ICU Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis, or Completed Heliobacter Pylori (H. Pylori) infection, which are common indications for PPI use.

Given the lack of a clear diagnosis that would necessitate the use of a PPI, the recommendation to deprescribe the medication has been made.","[{'diagnosis_boolean': '0', 'explanation': ""The provided information does not mention Barrett's Esophagus or esophageal cell changes, Chronic Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory (NSAID) use or GI prophylaxis NSAID use, Severe esophagitis including bleeding esophagitis or esophageal ulcer, or History of gastrointestinal bleeding, gastric ulcer, upper GI bleed, or peptic ulcer hemorrhage.
